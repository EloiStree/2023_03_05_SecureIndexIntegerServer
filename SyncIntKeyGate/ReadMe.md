Sync Int Key is a algo that I tried to create that is usable in Javascript and C#.
It shuffle a integer with user given time and array shuffling.
If you are who you say you are the server and the user should be able guess the current and next integer

Hash Sync Int Key is the same algo but we take the index, proof and value to generate a integer that hash in a int byte.
The aim is to be sure that, if hacked, some can't just change the value given by copying the proof.
The hash use a value known by the client and the server.
