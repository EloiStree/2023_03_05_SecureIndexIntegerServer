# 2023_03_05_SecureIndexIntegerServerGates


Did not find a good solution.

Some work better with RSA some with AES
Some with integer sync that I tried to create
Soem with alternative of it
Some are better with a integer that is public but limited on the IP spam...

Conclusion:
For me the best soluation is to have a unprotect integer server working with UDP and memory sharing.
Then add some gates on several port depending of the context of what user need as protection.
It Create a bit more latency on the communication but the alternative is a software the do everything with threads every where.

Draft of the idea:
